      "Today we live in a world of information overload. \"Which phone should i buy? What is the best car? Which house should I get?\" The list goes on and on.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are a variety of strategies to solve such challenges in decision making. We can ask friends, experts, search the internet, or just making a best guess. \n",
      "\n",
      "The main goal of a recommender system is to assist users with this cognitive overload. See it as a personal advisor for the users. This will in turn translate to revenue and profit for the companies when users buy more, click more, or view more.\n",

      "# The \"Recommendation Problem\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It is a utiliy function that is trying to estimate or predict how a user will like an item. This prediction is going to based on data we collect such as past behavior, relations to other users, items similarity, context, and other. It all depends on the kind of data that we have."

      "The effectiveness of the method depends on the domain and problem. There is no one size fits all method. In the most general case, without much information, the first effective approach would be collaborative filtering. There are other approaches we can combine to improve the results in specific cases such as the cold-start problem. \n",

      "What really matters is the data processing involved, understanding how to filter signal and noise, normalizing global effects, removing outliers. We can also consider dimensionsion reduction to deal with sparse matrices."
